# Big Board

A cyberpunk-themed TUI for assessing contributor volumes across git repositories. Inspired by Hiro Protagonist's Big Board from Neal Stephenson's *Snow Crash*.

## Install

Big Board requires the `git` command-line client on `PATH`.

### From Source

```bash
go install github.com/richhaase/bigboard/cmd/bigboard@latest
```

## Usage

Big Board is TUI-first: preferences live in the config file, and the CLI has exactly four flags.

```bash
# Analyze current directory
bigboard

# Analyze specific repos or scan directories for repos
bigboard ~/src/repo1 ~/src/repo2
bigboard ~/src/

# Use a named group from your config
bigboard --group backend

# Print contributor stats as JSON and exit (all-time window)
bigboard --export ~/src/ > board.json

# Use an alternate config file
bigboard --config ./bigboard.json

# Print version and exit
bigboard --version
```

The time range is chosen interactively (`←/→`) and defaults to 14 days. Set
`since` in the config to choose the initial range. `--export` always covers
all time; per-contributor first/last commit dates are included for downstream
filtering.

## Accuracy notes

- **Author identity** is resolved by git's native `.mailmap` (honored automatically for `%aN`/`%aE`), then grouped by email and exact name. Substring name merging (which can collapse distinct people like *Daniel* / *Daniela*) is **off by default** — enable it with `"fuzzy": true`. Add a `.mailmap` to a repo to canonicalize names/emails precisely.
- **AI authorship** is detected from `Co-authored-by` trailers and AI author identities, including agent accounts that commit via GitHub (`Copilot`, `claude[bot]`, `devin-ai-integration[bot]`, `google-labs-jules[bot]`, …). Add your own agents' emails or `@domains` under `ai_identities`.
- **Bots are counted, not hidden.** Bot accounts (`dependabot[bot]`, `renovate[bot]`, your own agents via `bot_identities`) rank on the leaderboard with a `BOT` tag; press `b` to toggle them out of view.
- **Generated & vendored files** (lockfiles, `vendor/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `*.min.*`, `*.snap`, `go.sum`, …) are excluded from line counts by default so they don't inflate scores. Set `"all_files": true` to count everything.
- **Scope** is each repo's default branch, `--no-merges`. Squash-merge workflows credit the merger; rename/copy churn is normalized via `-M -C`.

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑/↓` `j/k` | Navigate rows |
| `←/→` `h/l` | Cycle time range (1d / 7d / 14d / 30d / 90d / 1y / all) |
| `Enter` | Drill into selected contributor |
| `Esc` | Back / Quit |
| `s` | Cycle sort column (commits / added / removed / net / ai / total) |
| `S` | Reverse sort direction |
| `/` | Filter contributors by name (incremental) |
| `b` | Toggle bot contributors in/out |
| `r` | Open repo inclusion/exclusion overlay |
| `space` | Toggle a repo in/out (within the repo overlay) |
| `R` | Refresh (re-scan all repos) |
| `q` | Quit (clears an active filter first) |

In the contributor detail view, `↑/↓` step to the previous/next contributor.

## Config file

Optional, at `~/.config/bigboard/config.json` (override with `--config`).

```json
{
  "paths": ["~/src"],
  "exclude": ["vendor-*", "org-a/api"],
  "sort": "net",
  "since": "90d",
  "theme": "dark",
  "fuzzy": false,
  "all_files": false,
  "depth": 2,
  "groups": {
    "backend": ["~/src/api", "~/src/workers"],
    "frontend": ["~/src/web"]
  },
  "ai_identities": ["my-agent@example.com", "@agents.example.com"],
  "bot_identities": ["my-agent@example.com"]
}
```

- `since` takes a preset label: `1d`, `7d`, `14d`, `30d`, `90d`, `1y`, or `all`.
- `exclude` entries match a repo basename, a unique display name like `org-a/api` (for duplicate basenames), or a glob of either.
- `ai_identities` marks commits by those authors (or co-authors) as AI-assisted; entries are exact emails or `@domain` suffixes.
- `bot_identities` tags contributors as bots; entries are exact emails, `@domain` suffixes, or exact author names.
- Select a group with `--group backend`. Author identities can also be canonicalized with a standard git `.mailmap` in each repo.

## Features

- ASCII art banner with vertical color gradient
- Streaming repository-scan loader that surfaces unreadable repos as they load
- Gradient impact bars with trailing glow; gold/silver/bronze rank styling
- AI-authorship as a first-class metric: leaderboard `AI%` column, per-month AI share, per-repo AI %
- Bot contributors counted and tagged (`BOT`), with a one-key toggle to hide them
- Per-contributor drill-down: repo breakdown, gap-aware monthly timeline, neon contribution heatmap, and derived metrics (active days, first/last commit, churn)
- Scrollable, height-aware leaderboard with incremental `/` search — every contributor reachable
- Headless `--export` (JSON, same pipeline and identity policy as the TUI), config file with named `--group`s, glob excludes, and recursive scan depth
- Accurate-by-default: native `.mailmap`, generated/vendored files excluded, deterministic ordering, rename/copy-aware churn
- Git worktree detection (automatically skipped during repo discovery); symlinked repo directories are followed and deduplicated
